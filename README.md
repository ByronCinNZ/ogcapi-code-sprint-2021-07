About the Code Sprint
----------------

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites software developers to the July 2021 OGC API Virtual Code Sprint, to be held from July 21st to July 23rd , 2021. The code sprint will begin at 07:00am EDT on the first day, and end at 05:30pm EDT on the last day.

A pre-event webinar, lasting up to one hour, will take place on July 14th at 09:00am EDT. The webinar will set out the scope of the code sprint and provide an overview of the candidate standards.

The July 2021 OGC API Virtual Code Sprint will focus on the following draft OGC API specifications:

* The draft [OGC API - Processes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes) specification defines an interface that enables the execution of geospatial computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing their purpose and functionality. Typically, these processes execute well-defined algorithms that ingest vector and/or coverage data to produce new datasets.  
* The draft [OGC API - Records](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records) specification defines an interface that enables discovery and access to metadata records about resources such as features, coverages, tiles / maps, models, assets, services or widgets. The draft specification enables the discovery of geospatial resources by standardizing the way collections of descriptive information about the resources (metadata) are exposed and accessed.
* The draft [OGC API - Coverages](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/coverages) specification defines an interface that enables access to coverages that are modeled according to the Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.1. Coverages are represented by some binary or ASCII serialization, specified by some data (enÂ­coding) format. Arguably the most popular type of coverage is that of a gridded coverage. Gridded coverages have a grid as their domain set describing the direct positions in multi-dimensional coordinate space, depending on the type of grid. Satellite imagery is typically modeled as a gridded coverage, for example.
